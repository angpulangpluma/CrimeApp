				The Philippines is one of the most beautiful countries in the world where it even earned its title as the Pearl of the Orient but due to crime we
				often doubt the beauty of this nation because of a lack in safety and security. The application aims to help people not just make people be more secured 
				but also make them feel safer in their own space. It is a cross platform application that helps people be more informed and aware about the criminal activity 
				around their area in the Philippines.

			The data that is used by the application are taken from various sources. One of the main 
			sources of information would be government agencies willing to share their information 
			publicly such as the Philippine National Police and the Philippine Statistics Authority.
			Another source of information of would be third party organizations who have credibility 
			such as The Philippine Inquirer and CNN Philippines. Processing information is done with 
			the use of Deep Learning to identify possible anomalies in the data gathered.

<!--<p>

Information that will be displayed in our app with come from the following sources:
- Government offices such as PNP and PSA
- Third-party organizations who have gathered and agreed to share their own crime data
- Judiciary institutions (e.g. courts) who are willing to share the cases they have resolved to the public
<b>THE PROBLEM:</b>
</br>
Crime in the Philippines is at large due to multiple factors, <br/>
one of them being the inefficiency of our police force in preventing and solving them <br/>
and inadequate statistical basis of their inefficiency.<br/><br/>
Discrepancies of crime statistics exist. For example, the total number of murders in 2014 is <br/>
9,756 by the Philippine National Police (PNP) while for the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) counts 9,945. <br/><br/>
Also, crime solving efficiency, or the ratio of crimes solved over total number of cases is <br/>
counted by the PSA at 31.71% as of 2013, half the number in 2012.<br/>

<p>
<b>WHY IS IT NICE?</b></br>

</p>

<p>
<b>WHY IS IT NEW?</b></br>
<ul>
<li> Visualizing criminal data is not new</li>
<li> Cite foreign example </li>
<li> Cite local example</li>
</ul>
</br>
<b>FEATURES:</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>'Heatmap' of safe and unsafe places.</li>
<li>Phone notifications of when passing by or <br/>
just finished passing over and unavoidable unsafe space</br></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>WHY IS IT NEEDED?</b></br>
<ul>
<li>Education is the first step to prevent crime--<br/>
if one knows where and when they are to pass through <br/>
an unsafe area, they can be reminded to be on-guard of <br/>
themselves, their surroundings and their belongings.</li>
</li>
<li>Public consolidated source of criminal activity and hotspots</li>
</ul>
